## Extending Application

Note that our main App.java file (or whatever we call our main file) extends the abstract class `Application`.  The Application class has an abstract method called `start()`.  So the programmer must immediately implement start.

In the archetype we are using the template includes a basic start() method.  But some ways of creating a JavaFX program require the programmer to type it out.

## `main()`

Main appears in lines 25 through 27.  The main() method only launches the static method `launch()`.  With Maven and modern versions of JavaFX it is possible to call launch() directly and not have main() at all.

## What does `launch()` do?

It does quite a bit of setup.  Then it calls start()

## `start()`

The archetype we are using gives us a good start.

## The JavaFX Metaphor

At the heart of JavaFX is a theater metaphore.  The window itself is the ***Stage***.  The programmer writes a series of ***Scenes*** that go onto the stage.  A program may have several stages that get swapped onto the stage.

A stage is a container.  It holds multiple nodes that are arranged in a tree.  

The arrangement of the nodes when they are displayed on the screen is handled by layout managers.

After the stage and scene, the theater metaphor breaks down.  The stage contains containers.  Various types of Panes are the main thing added to the scene.
